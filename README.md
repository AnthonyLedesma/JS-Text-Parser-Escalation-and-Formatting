# JS-Text-Parser---Escalation-and-Formatting
Demo content for account escalations. Intend to pull out only necessary information for quick account information gathering.

Properly pulling default and primary domains, Site ID, Customer Number and formatting in pre-selected template. 

Added ability to add recursive site info to the template.

Still Needed:

-CSS Style

-Extraction of site checks (need demo data) to place within template.

-Working testing model. Would like to host and integrate on confluence.
