# JS-Text-Parser---Escalation-and-Formatting
Demo content for account escalations. Intend to pull out only necessary information for quick account information gathering.

Properly pulling default and primary domains, Site ID, Customer Number and formatting in pre-selected template. 

Added ability to add recursive site info to the template.

Added default and primary domain name comparison to help with site check comparison.

Working testing model can now be found on Pact Confluence Home Page.

Still Needed:

-CSS Style

-Extraction of site checks (need demo data) to place within template.

-Reset default settings button for template generator.

-Manual Site Checks should have domain specification.
